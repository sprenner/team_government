It really depends on your text data. In some lines of work, it's very common that the top words or phrases are NOT stop words because you work with dense text (search query data) in very specific topics.\n",

    "Use min_df as an integer to remove rare-occurring words. If they only occur once or twice, they won't add much value and are usually really obscure. Furthermore, there's generally a lot of them so ignoring them with say min_df=5 can greatly reduce your memory consumption and data size.\n",
